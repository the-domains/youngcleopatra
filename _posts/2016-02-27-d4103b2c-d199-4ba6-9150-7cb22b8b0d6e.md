[**Born a Princess**  
Cleopatra was born a princess of Egypt. Her father was the Pharaoh Ptolemy VII.
Cleopatra was smart and cunning growing up. She was her father's favorite child
and learned a lot about how the country was ruled from him.   
Cleopatra's family had ruled Egypt for 300 years. They were the Ptolemy dynasty
that had been established by the Greek ruler Alexander the
Great. Even though they ruled Egypt, they were actually of Greek descent.
Cleopatra grew up speaking, reading, and writing Greek. Unlike many of her
relatives, however, Cleopatra also learned many other languages including
Egyptian and Latin. ][0]
