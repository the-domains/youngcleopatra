**Born a Princess**  
Cleopatra was born a princess of Egypt. Her father was the Pharaoh Ptolemy VII.
Cleopatra was smart and cunning growing up. She was her father's favorite child
and learned a lot about how the country was ruled from him.   
Cleopatra's family had ruled Egypt for 300 years. They were the Ptolemy dynasty
that had been established by the Greek ruler [Alexander the
Great][0]. Even though they ruled Egypt, they were actually of Greek descent.
Cleopatra grew up speaking, reading, and writing Greek. Unlike many of her
relatives, however, Cleopatra also learned many other languages including
Egyptian and Latin. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1759a016-336c-4be1-b48e-08fa1f62d044.JPG)

**Even though she's a
princess, this has nothing to do with her finding a prince; it's about her
tenacity of character and the betrayal of family when the mythical world of
Egypt, they live in, backfires.Cleo has
no patience for the gods but has to use wisdom over weaponry to appease them in
order to protect her family and the region.**

**Of course Cleo does
become the rightful pharaoh of Egypt -- the last there would ever be, and she
does so at the age of 15, with the hard won support of the commoners, something
her father nor the family dynasty, ever had. **

**More than a wistful
princess or kick-ass female, (although there is some of the latter),
Cleopatra's youth represents the reality of family dynamics and the practice of
wisdom over weaponry. **

**Her story resonates today, not only because of
the universality of the family dysfunction but for what she represents in such
a male-dominated society swept up in the fanatacism of close-minded beliefs.**

In an era when Egypt was roiled by
internal and external battles, Young Cleopatra brings the country together and
proves to be as powerful a leader as any of her male counterparts.
