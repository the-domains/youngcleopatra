**Even though she's a princess, this has nothing to do with her finding a prince; it's about her tenacity of character and the betrayal of family when the mythical world of Egypt, they live in, backfires.Cleo has no patience for the gods but has to use wisdom over weaponry to appease them in order to protect her family and the region.**

**Of course Cleo does become the rightful pharaoh of Egypt -- the last there would ever be, and she does so at the age of 15, with the hard won support of the commoners, something her father nor the family dynasty, ever had.**

**More than a wistful princess or kick-ass female, (although there is some of the latter), Cleopatra's youth represents the reality of family dynamics and the practice of wisdom over weaponry.**
